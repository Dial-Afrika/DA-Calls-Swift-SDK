# DACalls SDK Refactoring Summary

## Completed Steps
1. Created proper Swift package directory structure:
   - Sources/DACalls/Core (existing)
   - Sources/DACalls/Services (existing)
   - Sources/DACalls/UI (new, populated with UI components)
   - Sources/DACalls/Helpers (new, started populating)
   - Sources/DACalls/Resources (new)
   - Tests/DACallsTests (new, basic test created)
   - Examples (new, basic example created)

2. Refactored UI components from DACallView.swift into separate files:
   - DACallView.swift
   - DACallViewModel.swift
   - DADialPadView.swift
   - DADialView.swift
   
3. Updated Package.swift with proper metadata.

4. Updated CHANGELOG.md to reflect the refactoring.

5. Added a basic example app in the Examples directory.

6. Created an AppDelegate helper class.

## Pending Steps
1. Move any remaining files from the old locations to their proper places in the Swift package structure.

2. Fix import errors for UIKit in the Helpers directory.

3. Fix import errors for XCTest in the test files.

4. Ensure all components are properly referenced and can be imported correctly.

5. Create full documentation for the refactored SDK structure.

6. Update any import paths in existing code to reflect the new structure.

7. Add proper examples showing how to use the refactored SDK.

## Expected Benefits of Refactoring
1. Better organization and maintainability of the codebase.

2. Proper Swift Package Manager support for easier distribution.

3. Clear separation of UI components, services, and core functionality.

4. Easier testing and documentation of the SDK.

5. Simplified integration for developers using the SDK.
